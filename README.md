# PropChain Smart Contracts

> 🏠 **Decentralized Real Estate Infrastructure** | Rust-based smart contracts for blockchain-powered property transactions

PropChain Smart Contracts is a production-grade Rust-based smart contract system that enables the tokenization and trading of real estate assets through blockchain technology. Our contracts provide the core functionality needed to build decentralized real estate platforms, including property ownership, secure transfers, and escrow services.

Built with Rust and ink! for Substrate/Polkadot ecosystem, these smart contracts serve as the foundation for Web3 real estate applications, enabling developers to create platforms where physical properties can be represented as digital assets and traded seamlessly using cryptocurrency.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Capabilities
- **🏠 Asset Tokenization**: Transform physical real estate properties into tradable NFTs with legal compliance
- **💰 Secure Transfers**: Multi-signature property transfers with escrow protection
- **🔗 Property Registry**: On-chain property ownership registry with metadata storage
- **📊 Fractional Ownership**: Enable partial ownership and investment pooling
- **🔐 Access Control**: Role-based permissions for property owners, agents, and regulators
- **💾 On-chain Storage**: Decentralized storage for property documents and metadata

### Advanced Features
- **⛓️ Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Designed for Substrate/Polkadot ecosystem with EVM compatibility
- **📈 Property Valuation**: On-chain valuation oracle integration for real-time pricing
- **🔍 Property Discovery**: Efficient on-chain search and filtering capabilities
- **📱 Mobile Integration**: Lightweight contract interfaces for mobile dApps
- **🛡️ Security First**: Formal verification and comprehensive audit coverage

## 👥 Target Audience

This smart contract system is designed for:
- **Real Estate Tech Companies** building blockchain-based property platforms
- **Property Investment Firms** seeking fractional ownership solutions
- **Blockchain Developers** creating DeFi real estate applications on Substrate
- **Real Estate Agencies** modernizing their transaction infrastructure
- **FinTech Startups** integrating real estate into their crypto ecosystems

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Rust** 1.70+ (stable toolchain)
- **ink! CLI** for smart contract development
- **Substrate Node** for local testing
- **Git** version control

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MettaChain/PropChain-contract.git
cd PropChain-contract

# 2. Run automated setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# 3. Start local development environment
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Build the contracts
./scripts/build.sh --release

# 5. Run tests
./scripts/test.sh

# 6. Deploy locally (optional)
./scripts/deploy.sh --network local
```

The contracts will be compiled and ready for deployment to Substrate-based networks.

## 🚀 Development & Deployment

### Development Environment
```bash
./scripts/build.sh        # Build contracts in debug mode
./scripts/test.sh         # Run unit tests
cargo test                 # Run all tests including integration
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
./scripts/build.sh --release  # Build optimized contracts
./scripts/deploy.sh --network westend  # Deploy to testnet
./scripts/deploy.sh --network polkadot  # Deploy to mainnet
```

### Testing Suite
```bash
./scripts/test.sh                      # Run all tests
./scripts/test.sh --coverage           # Run with coverage
./scripts/e2e-test.sh                  # Run E2E tests

# Load Testing (Performance Validation)
./scripts/load_test.sh                 # Run full load test suite
cargo test --package propchain-tests load_test_concurrent_registration_light --release  # Quick validation
cargo test --package propchain-tests stress_test_mass_registration --release  # Stress test
```
